# Ideathon Web Scraping and Data Analysis

This project consists of two notebooks for scraping data from a website and performing analysis on it. The first notebook (`ideathon_web_script.ipynb`) scrapes the data from the web and saves it as a CSV file. The second notebook (`ideathon.ipynb`) loads the scraped data and performs analysis or further processing.

## Prerequisites

Before running the notebooks, ensure that you have access to Google Colab. You don't need to install any dependencies locally as Colab provides all the necessary libraries.

## Getting Started

### 1. Open the Notebooks in Google Colab

To start, you can open the notebooks directly in Google Colab:

- **Web Scraping Notebook** (`ideathon_web_script.ipynb`): Click on [Open in Colab] in the starting of the code directly takes us to the colab
- **Data Analysis Notebook** (`ideathon.ipynb`): Click on [Open in Colab] in the starting of the code directly takes us to the colab
### 2. Run the Web Scraping Notebook

First, run the `ideathon_web_script.ipynb` notebook to scrape data from the target website and save it as a CSV file (`reviews.csv`).

In the `ideathon_web_script.ipynb` notebook:
- It fetches data from the specified URL
- Parses the HTML content
- Extracts the relevant data
- Saves the data into a CSV file (`reviews.csv`)

Once the notebook has run successfully, the scraped data will be available as a CSV file, which you can download.

### 3. Run the Data Analysis Notebook

Once the data has been scraped and saved, you can run the `ideathon.ipynb` notebook to load the CSV file and perform analysis or other processing tasks.

In the `ideathon.ipynb` notebook:
- Need to load the downloaded file in the colab application `reviews.csv`.Navigate to table of content under files option then there you can find the upward arror symbol name upload to session storage and upload the downloaded file
- Cleans and preprocesses the data (e.g., removing missing values)
- Performs data analysis and generates summary statistics
  
After the analysis is complete, you will be able to see the results in the notebook.

## Notebooks Overview

### `ideathon_web_script.ipynb`
- Scrapes data from a website using the `requests` library and `BeautifulSoup`.
- Extracts relevant data (adjustable based on the website structure).
- Saves the scraped data as a CSV file (`reviews.csv`).

### `ideathon.ipynb`
- Loads the scraped data (`reviews.csv`).
- Cleans and preprocesses the data (e.g., removing missing values).
- Performs data analysis and generates summary statistics.

## Dependencies

No need to install dependencies manually as Google Colab provides the necessary libraries for running these notebooks. The essential libraries used in this project include:

- `requests`: for HTTP requests
- `beautifulsoup4`: for HTML parsing
- `pandas`: for data manipulation

Google Colab will automatically install the necessary packages when you run the notebooks.
